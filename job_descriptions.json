Braintrust\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unique network model allows talent to retain 100% of their market rate, while enabling organizations to pull together flexible teams of highly-skilled technical and design talent, no matter where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re located. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, with Braintrust, organizations can make their budgets go 2-3 times further by cutting out unnecessary, expensive middle men. This new business model of minimizing fees and enabling users to control the network is uniquely enabled by a blockchain token. Our core beliefs:   While talent is equally distributed around the world opportunity is not.  The old models of how people work are dull, outdated and in urgent need of reinvention.  People should be able to do the work they love, on their own terms, and keep 100% of the value.  Braintrust was founded by 2 successful serial entrepreneurs: Adam Jackson, Gabriel Luna-Ostaseski and has raised $25M+ from leading Silicon Valley investors including IDEO, True Ventures and Homebrew. Braintrust currently serves large enterprises such as Nestle, Deloitte, PwC, Porsche, Blue Cross, Pacific Life, Coursera and many more.
