Rather, we initially seek to win over \"fandom,\" brands, as well as those who have a casual interest in the areas. Moreover, both our rollout of and approach to e-commerce are very inspired including more interesting and compelling options for \"normal\" consumers/users, fandom/connoisseurs, as well as makers compared to present offerings.
